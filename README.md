This project allows you to deploy the Reddit application in docker containers
on your machine.   
Your data will be stored on "reddit_db" volume.   
Read about the installation of Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

## Run application with Docker Compose

This command will start four containers with Reddit application and one with
Prometheus for monitoring:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Stop application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

```

Container with Comment application:

```bash
cd comment
bash docker_build.sh
```

Container with Post application:

```bash
cd post-py
bash docker_build.sh
```

Container with Prometheus:

```bash
cd prometheus
